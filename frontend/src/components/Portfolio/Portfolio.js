                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My journey at Eastern has been a robust training ground for a spectrum of invaluable skills sought after in today's professional landscape. Through courses spanning evolutionary psychology, social psychology, adolescent psychology, and research methods, I've honed my critical thinking prowess. Crafting papers within these domains provided me ample opportunities to showcase my adeptness in identifying needs, contextualizing situations, and performing logical analysesâ€”an integral facet of critical thinking.

I've consistently demonstrated an aptitude for effectively exchanging information, ideas, and perspectives, both within the academic realm and in interactions extending beyond the institution's confines. This capacity to articulate thoughts and substantiate viewpoints has been pivotal in my academic journey.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next couple of years, my primary focus is on pursuing a Master's in clinical social work immediately following my undergraduate studies. This will lay the foundation for my short-term goal of establishing a private practice in therapy and social work, with a particular emphasis on serving my community. The action plan to achieve this involves attending graduate school while concurrently working part-time as a paraprofessional at Oak Hill Schools. This dual commitment is scheduled between 2024 and 2027. I am fortunate to have established a genuine relationship with the team at Oak Hill, who have graciously offered me a part-time position to support my education. My cultural background and upbringing, which prioritize education, provide the foundational resources for this endeavor. The unwavering support of my family serves as a crucial pillar in acquiring the experience needed to navigate this transitional phase.

                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking beyond the next five years, my long-term goal is to establish a community center that caters to the needs of my community, offering a comprehensive range of services such as therapy, a gym, daycare, and music lessons. Simultaneously, I aim to undertake research to enhance community interactions. Additionally, I aspire to engage in local politics after 2035. The action plan entails the establishment of the community center, implementation of a retreat program doubling as a rehabilitation initiative for individuals struggling with addiction, and eventually running for local political office. Achieving this will require an extensive network, financial prudence, and diverse experiences gained along the way. My Psi Chi membership at Eastern will be pivotal in fostering connections, while the support of my family and friends will be instrumental in acquiring the necessary experiences and financial resources. This concerted effort will contribute to creating a lasting impact on my community and beyond.
